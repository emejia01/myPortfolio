        <h1> About Erik</h1>
        <br>
        <center><p class="about-me-text"> 
            I am currently an undergrad student at Manhattan College in New York City. I was 
            born and raised in Yonkers, NY, a neighboring city to the Bronx. Although 
            New York is where I was raised, I’ve always seen myself traveling throughout 
            the country to experience new places!
        </p></center>
        <br>
        <center><p class="about-me-text">
            During my time at Manhattan College I was always interested in Engineering, 
            however it wasn’t until after my freshman year that I considered majoring in 
            Computer Science. In fact, I was originally a Mechanical Engineering major 
            before I was introduced to programming. However, when I finally decided to make 
            the ‘swap’ to Computer Science I had come to find out that I was one of the best 
            decisions I’d made in my life!
        </p></center>
        <br>
        <center><p class="about-me-text">
            Currently I am in the middle of completing my undergrad degree in CS with a 
            concentration in Machine Learning and Intelligence and a Mathematics minor. 
            Some of my relevant course work includes Data Structures and Algorithms, 
            Computer Security, Data Mining, Object Oriented Design with Java and Linear 
            Algebra and Statistics. Aside from school work, I spend a lot of my time 
            working on personal projects. One of my favorites was a Class Registration Bot 
            for students at my University. Watching students use it for their own schedules 
            was especially rewarding.

            <h3> News Scraper and Sentiment Analyzer</h3>
            <p> This is a console-based Python program that is able to extract the textual data from the URL of 
                a news article webpage <strong> (Currently works with CNN, MSNBC/NBC News, The Washington Post, and Fox News )</strong>. 
                After extracting the data, the text is then analyzed against a list of positive and negative sentiment 
                words to determine whether the narrative of the article is positive or negative.

            <h3> Manhattan-College-Class-Registration-Automator </h3>
            <p> AutoReg is a python GUI based program that allows Manhattan College students to register for their 
                desired courses as soon as the registration portal time opens. This program automates the registration 
                process so that actual registration time happens in milliseconds, increasing the probability of 
                successfully registering for all your desired classes.

                process. With Auto-mate, students would only need to provide their Manhattan College student credentials and the applicable Course Registration Number
                of that the program and attempt registration.
